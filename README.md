# jrshell

jrshell is a custom Unix-like shell built in C. It provides fundamental shell functionalities, allowing users to execute commands, manage processes, and handle basic I/O redirection.

This is an ongoing project I started in May 2025 to learn more about the Linux terminal and the C programming language.

## Running the Project

#### Prerequisites
You will need a C compiler (`run.sh` uses GCC) and a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL).

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/reiner-13/jrshell.git
        cd jrsehll

2. Compile the source code and run:

    For GCC:
    
        gcc -o main.exe main.c
        ./main.exe
    
    or
    
        source run.sh
